# React Slideshow App and Sorting Articles App

This repository contains two separate React.js applications: a Slideshow App and a Sorting Articles App. Each application is located in its respective folder within the repository. The Slideshow App allows you to create and display a slideshow of text and title with the ability to restart, go to the next slide, and go to the previous slide, while the Sorting Articles App allows you to sort articles based on the latest date or high upvotes.

## Slideshow App

The Slideshow App is located in the `slideshow-app` folder. This is a simple Slideshow App built with React.js. It allows you to navigate through a series of slides with the ability to restart, go to the next slide, and go to the previous slide. The app also disables the restart button when on the first slide, disables the previous button when on the first slide, and disables the next button when on the last slide.
To run the Slideshow App:

1. Navigate to the `slideshow-app` folder.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.

## Sorting Articles App

The Sorting Articles App is located in the `sorting-articles-app` folder. This application allows users to view and sort articles based on the latest date or high upvotes. The app fetches articles from an external API and provides an intuitive user interface to sort and filter the articles accordingly. This app helps users stay up-to-date with the latest articles and discover popular content.

To run the Sorting Articles App:

1. Navigate to the `sorting-articles-app` folder.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
